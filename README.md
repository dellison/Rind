# rind

Using Clojure for naive bayes text classification. For fun!

It's called "rind" after the part of the fruit or vegetable that you don't want to eat.

## Usage

First, cd to this directory and run:

    ./getcorpus.sh

This downloads the
[Enron-Spam email corpus](http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/)
for spam detection and the
[Cornell movie review corpus](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)
for sentiment classification
using the wget tool.

Now you should be able to run the program with

    lein run

This will train a Naive Bayes classifier, first on sections 1-4 of the
Enron-Spam corpus for testing on sections 5 and 6, and second on the
first 900 positive and 900 negative movie reviews, for testing on the
last 100 of each.

It will use several feature extraction functions:

- bag-of-words
- bag-of-words (excluding stopwords, using nltk's stopword list)
- bigrams
- trigrams

For each of these tasks, the accuracy and confusion matrix will be printed.
